                The developed product is a webapp, which makes use of the audio and video of Amazon Connect agents in order to facilitate the training of future agents. The app's main functionality is to integrate the recording of an agent's desktop during an Amazon Connect call, as well as having a separate view for supervisors where they are able to view and assign all available recordings.

                Apart from that, here are the project's main business objectives:

                Added value: Provide an added value to Amazon Connect services to provide better efficiency at supporting Amazon Connect customers and increase organizational efficiency
                Resource management: Try to be as efficient as possible with resource management so that it doesn't jeopardize Amazon's current operations
                Easy to use application: Develop an easy to use and understand application so that customers don't feel intimidated by its complex design
                Agent training: Facilitate agent training procedures for Amazon Connect customers.

                For more information please check the manual of the web-app.
